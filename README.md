### Description
Frontend coding challenge is a project presented by `"United Remote"` Company to evaluate job suppliers based on achieving and respecting the specifications given.

### Framework used
This challenge was made by `Angular 7`, just because i'm familial with it and it's more documented, also more organized comparing to other `SPA frameworks` and more oraganis.

### Libraries installed
The power of frameworks consists on the libraries performed and installed wich helps developers to achieve and unleash tasks with high velocity and efficiency without errors.

- [x] `Bootstrap 4` : since we're in smartphones and tablets era, we've to create a solution wich it runs and being responsive in all devices (Tablets - Phones - Laptops) even if Tvs, so the most relevent tool is `Bootstrap 4` css framework.

- [x] `Infinite Scroll` : In the specifications given by `"United Remote"` Company, that they want to use infinite scroll or endless scroll when user scroll down his mouse.
Github api link serves 1000 repositories, each page contains 30 repositories as max, so a simple `1000/3 = about 33 pages`, so we can't display all the 1000 repositories as one batch in term of performance and rapidity. the trick is : the first time the page loaded we load 30 reositories, and after user's scroll down and when user achieve the 30 repositories we increment the page param to get the next 30 repositories. `Infinite Scroll` library will resolve this.

- [x] `TSLint` : In project developement, as a team or particual, the code must be flexible, correct and follows the same rules, this library helps developers to manage and fix syntaxes and rules automatically.
